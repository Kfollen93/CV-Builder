<i>A brief project utilzing <b>React</b> and <b>TypeScript</b>, that was built with <b>Vite</b>.</i>

## Description
This CV Builder React App is a user-friendly web application that allows you to create a resume by entering your personal information, work experience, and education details. The app takes care of styling and formatting, giving you a preview of what your resume will look like in a basic yet polished format.

## Development
The intention of this project was to make more React applications, specifically using TypeScript, from the ground up. The majority of my work is in done in .NET Core and C#, but I often have corresponding frontend tasks to link up the backend endpoints that I have created. While I have gained more experience with React through doing that, I am not often tasked with creating components from scratch, as most of the groundwork is already there.

## Technologies Used
- React
- TypeScript
- Bootstrap
